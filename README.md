# Response of P. acuta and M. capitata early life stages to future warming and acidification conditions

## Environmental context, target temperature and pH

Overall, it is predicted that seawater temperature will increase by 0.2–3.5 °C with concomitant drops in pH of 0.1–0.3 units by the year 2100, depending on the CO2 emissions scenario (IPCC, 2019).
Target temperature and pH conditions for the experiment: control (present-day temperature with present-day pH), ocean acidification (present-day temperature crossed with -0.15 and - 0.3 pH units), and combined end-of-century warming and acidification conditions (+1.5°C with -0.15 pH, +3.5°C with -0.3 pH).
