# A gradient of warming and acidification highlights physiological, molecular, and skeletal tolerance thresholds in _Pocillopora acuta_ recruits

This electronic notebook provides the data and scripts employed to analyze the molecular, physiological, biomineralization, and ecological, responses of early life stages of _Pocillopora acuta_, a common reef-building coral in Kāne‘ohe Bay, to projected ocean warming and acidification scenarios.
